Description: Replacement for plexus-utils in Maven
 This project aims to be a functional replacement for plexus-utils in Maven.
 .
 It is not a 100% API compatible replacement though, but a replacement with
 improvements: lots of methods got cleaned up, generics got added and a lot
 of unused code was dropped.
