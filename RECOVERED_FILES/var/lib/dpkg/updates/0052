Description: set of low level HTTP transport components for Java
 HttpCore is a set of low level HTTP transport components that can be used
 to build custom client and server side HTTP services with a minimal
 footprint. HttpCore supports two I/O models:
 .
  - blocking I/O model, based on the classic Java I/O;
  - non-blocking, event driven I/O model based on Java NIO.
 .
 The blocking I/O model may be more appropriate for data intensive, low
 latency scenarios, whereas the non-blocking model may be more appropriate
 for high latency scenarios where raw data throughput is less important
 than the ability to handle thousands of simultaneous HTTP connections in
 a resource efficient manner.
