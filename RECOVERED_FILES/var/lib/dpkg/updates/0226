Description: Artifact transport abstraction used in Maven (HTTP providers)
 The Wagon project defines a simple API for transferring resources
 (artifacts) to and from repositories. The word repository is used in this
 context as it is commonly used in Maven and means a storage of artifacts.
 It is also used to deploy the Maven generated site to a server.
 .
 Wagon defines a unified API, and it currently has the following providers:
  * File
  * HTTP
  * HTTP lightweight
  * FTP
  * SSH/SCP
  * WebDAV
 .
 This package contains the wagon-http-* libraries.
